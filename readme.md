# How To Play
Welcome to my game. The game is a story based dice game. You will read through the story and select the outcomes you want. Dice will be rolled to determine if you win or lose. The goal of the game is to beat the horseman of conquest without dying. Here on this file you can get some tips on playing.

# Inputs
1. All inputs except for your age which has to be an interger, and your name will be multiple choice. This means you will enter 'a', 'b', 'c', etc. Capitals will not work

# Attacking
1. Attacking is done by the computer rolling a d20 (20 sided die) for you and the monster you are fighting.
2. If you roll higher than the monster's roll plus it's advantage, you will hit it.
3. If you hit it the computer will roll a d6 (6 sided die) and add your attack to the number it gets. That attack will be the damage you did.
4. The damage is subtracted from the monster's health.

# Monster Attacking
1. When the monster attacks it is a bit different.
2. A d20 is rolled for the monster and its advantage is added to that roll. That sum must be higher than the player's armor class to hit

# Running
1. In combat with certain enemies you are able to run
2. Like attacking, a d20 is rolled for both the monster and the player with the monster having its advantage added to its roll.
3. If the player rolls higher they get away. If they don't, they don't get away and the monster still gets to attack.
